# 30 Mini JavaScript Projects

### Overview
This repository contains 30 mini JavaScript projects that I am building to strengthen my JavaScript skills and gain practical experience in front-end development. 
These projects are developed by following tutorials and guidance from the JavaScript King YouTube channel.

### Objective
The goal of this project series is to:

Gain hands-on experience with JavaScript by building small yet impactful projects.
Improve understanding of core JavaScript concepts such as DOM manipulation, event handling, asynchronous programming, and more.
Enhance problem-solving skills and creativity in developing interactive web applications.

### Projects List
Some of the mini-projects included are:

- Pokedex
- A Digital Clock
- To-Do List Application
- Testimonial Slider
- Random Photos
- Random Color Generator

  ...and many more!

###Learning Approach

Each project is built step-by-step by following the tutorials from the JavaScript King channel.
The focus is on understanding key JavaScript features, best coding practices, and how to implement interactive features in web applications.
As I complete each project, I will add my own customizations and improvements to further personalize the learning experience.

### How to Use
Each project is stored in its own directory with the relevant HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
To run the projects, simply open the HTML files in your web browser.
Feel free to explore, modify, and expand the projects as you like.
